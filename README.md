# WordPress Deployment

This repository contains the source code for a WordPress website, and a GitHub Actions workflow is set up to automatically deploy the website to a VPS when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## Requirements

- A **VPS (Virtual Private Server)** with **Nginx** or **Apache** installed.
- **PHP** and **MySQL** installed on the VPS for WordPress to run.
- **SSH access** to the VPS (ensure the public SSH key is added to the VPS's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).
- A **GitHub account** and access to this repository.

## Setting Up the Local Environment

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wordpress-deployment.git
   cd wordpress-deployment


# For WordPress setup, you may need to install dependencies like PHP and MySQL locally

### Step 6: Push to GitHub

Finally, commit and push all the changes (including the `deploy.yml` and `README.md` files) to your repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Set up GitHub Actions workflow for WordPress deployment"
git push origin main
